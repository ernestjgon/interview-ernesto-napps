# Technical interview assignment

------------------------------------------------

This assignment is designed to understand how you work and what your preferences are. Don't feel nervous, there is no a correct answer, the source code may not compile and you can search in Google and Stackoverflow, we also do it!!

Here the assignment:

- Develop an application which will receive 3 parameters: a number N, the name of a file FILE1 and another name of a file FILE2.
- The application will make a request to the [Breaking bad quotes](https://github.com/shevabam/breaking-bad-quotes) service obtaining N quotes.
- It will create a file FILE1 in CSV format with two columns: AUTHOR and NUMBER_OF_QUOTES
- It will create another file FILE2 in CSV format with two columns: AUTHOR and NUMBER_OF_LETTERS ordered in descending mode.

Extra points if you:

- Add a TODO file explaining what more you will do if you would have more than 30 minutes. This is important.
- Add a very short README file explaining how to compile it, deploy it and use it. It may empty if you don't have time to do it, no problem at all. We'll discuss it later.

If you don't know how to start, please, ask to your interviewer.

Some things you must consider:

- Everything must be uploaded to github in this repository after 30 minutes. Be careful, if you don't know git, this may take longer that expected.
- Use English where you can use it.
- Java and Groovy are our favourites languages.
- Ask to your interviewer whatever you want, we are with you to help.

Good luck and take it easy!
